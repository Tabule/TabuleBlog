<p>We are very excited about Tabule cofounder Neil Gupta's <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/13489965-418/mayor-intent-on-making-chicago-a-start-up-city.html" target="_blank">press conference</a> with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel at 1871 last week, where Neil talked about why he chose Chicago over the Silicon Valley when starting Tabule, and Emanuel announced an expansion of the ThinkChicago program to encourage more students to make a similar decision as Neil. But enough of our talking, here's a video of the event!</p>
