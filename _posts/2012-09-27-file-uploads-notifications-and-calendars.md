File upload!

The koala will now keep your files safe for you! Working on a group project and need to share a file with everybody really quickly? Just click the little paper clip next to a post or comment, or drag and drop your files into your browser window to share them. Easy as pie.

Notifications!

Go to your [Notifications](https://tabuleapp.com/notif) page from Safari 6 on Mac OS X Mountain Lion or from Google Chrome, and your browser will ask you if you would like to allow notifications from Tabule. Click Accept (or OK or Aye aye cap'n), leave Tabule open in a tab, and forget about it. When you get a notification, you'll get a shiny popup alert like this one:

Click on it to see the post. Always stay on top of what's going on in your classes in real-time!

Calendar Syncing!

These updates just keep getting better and better, don't they? Well, I've saved the best for last. You can now sync your Tabule calendar with your Google Calendar, iCal, or any other calendaring application that supports the iCal format. Just go to your [settings](https://tabuleapp.com/settings) page and click on "Subscribe to Calendar." Then choose the option most relevant to you.

As always, more great features coming your way soon!
