<p>Some of you may be looking for the old Tabule that let instructors set up courses, encourage anonymous participation among students, and administer quizzes. Tabule was going to revolutionize the way teachers interacted with their students in a lecture environment. Currently, instructors are faced with a sea of blank faces when teaching in large lecture halls and students feel unengaged. Tabule was designed to tackle this problem. Unfortunately, we found that despite the praise and amazing support we received from several professors and students, Tabule did not work for all types of classes for various reasons. Based on feedback from teachers, students, and advisors, we have decided to refocus our efforts on students instead of instructors.</p>
<p>We have rethought Tabule to cater to students' principal activities revolving around classrooms: homework and discussion. One of the annoying things we dealt with during our college careers is the lack of a central homework system that showed test and assignment due dates. The other pain was the lack of a system for communicating with other students in the same class. Currently, this is done using emails with massive mailing lists, which is inefficient and spam-prone.</p>
<p>What this means for instructors is that you'll still be able to engage students and encourage discussions through Tabule. You can also share files, homework due dates, and announcements. However, you won't be able to ask quizzes or take attendance anymore. If you need to export data from the previous version of Tabule, send an email to <a href="mailto:support@tabuleapp.com">support@tabuleapp.com</a> and we'll help you out.</p>
<p>If you're a student, you can expect a much more robust and social communication tool and calendaring system. We are very excited about what we have planned and can't wait to let you get started using it.</p>
<p>We'll be posting more as we get closer to releasing the new Tabule. Be sure to check back here for updates, follow <a href="http://twitter.com/tabuleapp" target="_blank">@tabuleapp on Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://tabuleapp.com">sign up for an email notification</a> when we launch!</p>
