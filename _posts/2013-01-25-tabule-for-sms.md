We just launched our [iPhone app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tabule/id590235792?mt=8&uo=4) last week to help you easily keep track of your due dates, but what if you don't have an iPhone? Starting today, you can also enjoy all the benefits of Tabule by texting your due dates!

Start by adding your cell number to your profile from your account settings window. Don't worry, this number won't show to anybody else.

You will receive a text from us, asking you to reply "yes" to verify your number. Once you have done so, you can text us your due dates as if you were texting a friend and we'll remember them for you!

As an added bonus for smartphone users, you can also [sync your Tabule calendar](http://support.tabuleapp.com/knowledgebase/articles/117270-how-do-i-sync-tabule-with-my-calendar-) with Google Calendar to easily see your due dates from your phone.
