We're excited to announce the launch of Tabule 2.0. Almost every aspect of the app has been rewritten. Our focus in this update was to build a much smarter student planner. We believe that your planner should do as much of the organizational work for you as possible. There are two major features in this update to bring us closer to that goal.

**Import your Syllabus**

You can now take pictures of your syllabus and we'll add your homework for you! It doesn't get easier than that.

**Daily Study Plan**

Tabule analyzes your homework to create a customized daily study plan that shows what you need to work on today. It will even suggest papers or exams you should get a head start on, based on your workload and assignment difficulty. Our intelligent algorithms work hard to spread out your work, so that you never get overwhelmed with too much homework again.

In addition, we have a beautiful new look that fits right in with iOS 7. We think you'll love this update and look forward to hearing what you think.
