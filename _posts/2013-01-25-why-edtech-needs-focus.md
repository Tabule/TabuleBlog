title: Don't just build another Blackboard, focus on specific problems.

Technology in education is a hotly debated topic. Some feel that it should be left out of the classroom because it only serves to distract students, while others think that it should be embraced rather than feared. At [Tabule](https://tabuleapp.com), we are of course members of the latter school. However, we are also strong believers that technology needs to serve a purpose. You can't throw technology at a problem just for the sake of doing so and expect anything to change. Unfortunately, that's how education has been widely approached so far. 

The problem is that most Edtech companies don't consider how their product will influence user behavior. Sure, a smart board in every classroom that lets teachers interact with their computer sounds cool, but what practical purpose does it serve for most teachers? This problem persists because their customers are the schools, not students or teachers. Nobody asks the actual users what they want. With so many tech-savvy, smartphone-equipped youth, why do students still have to carry giant textbooks or feel the need to write reminders on their hands? Why are teachers ripping their hair out in frustration just to share an announcement? Imagine how backwards the world would seem if we still used paper maps. That's how broken education is right now.

Large-scale paradigm shifts, like what Khan Academy and Coursera are working towards, will take time and patience. In the meantime, it seems like so many startups today are just throwing technology at a problem, trying to see what sticks. They are reinventing existing solutions with shinier interfaces. That's why every few months, you see a whole new learning management system hoping to disrupt Blackboard without offering anything different. Good UI is important, but it isn't going to help students learn better on its own.

We need to consider how technology can be harnessed to solve *specific* problems. For example, at [Tabule](https://tabuleapp.com), we're focusing on a small problem that is a big pain for students: managing homework. It is unnecessarily difficult for students to stay organized and keep track of due dates. Carrying around a student planner isn't practical, and using a todo list requires effort to fill out a form and organize yourself whenever you want to add a date, so instead, students just write stuff in a notebook and forget, or on their hand and wash it off. In a word, staying organized sucks.

If we just wanted to throw technology at this problem, we would have built another todo list with a shinier interface than the last. But we thought about how we could actually *solve* this problem, and we built those features. Things like a natural language engine so that students can just jot down a note, like they already prefer to do now, and we'll organize for them. Or making it automatically collaborative so that every student in the class isn't repeatedly solving the same problem of staying organized on their own. As a result, we used modern technologies to solve a problem in a way that was not possible before.

Similarly, schools need to adopt technologies that actually cater to student behaviors to influence little changes that add up. That's the only way we will bring education into the 21st century. Unfortunately, while schools decide whether to purchase the latest smart boards, students are suffering. We need to start thinking about how technology can solve real problems, not just how we can put technology in the classroom.
