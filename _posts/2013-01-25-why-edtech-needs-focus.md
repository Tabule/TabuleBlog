Technology in education is a hotly debated topic. Some feel that it should be left out of the classroom because it only serves to distract students, while others think that it should be embraced rather than feared. I am, of course, a member of the latter school. However, I am also a strong believer that technology needs to serve a purpose. You can't throw technology at a problem just for the sake of doing so and expect anything to change.

Unfortunately, that's how education has been widely approached so far. Blackboard does everything, but it does nothing particularly well. Smart boards are cool, but they aren't particularly useful. The problem persists because the primary customers in this industry are the schools, not students or teachers. Nobody asks the users what they actually want. That's why every few months, you see another startup rebuilding Blackboard with a cleaner interface, hoping to disrupt them without offering anything meaningfully different.

We need to consider how technology can be harnessed to solve *specific* problems. For example, at [Tabule](https://tabuleapp.com), we're focusing on a small problem that is a big pain for students: managing homework. It is unnecessarily difficult for students to stay organized and keep track of due dates. Carrying around a student planner isn't practical, and using a todo list requires effort to fill out a form and organize yourself every time you want to add a date. As a result, students just write stuff on their hands or in a notebook, and forget.

If we just wanted to throw technology at this problem, we would have built another todo list with a shinier interface than the last. But we thought about how we could actually *solve* this problem, and we built those features. Things like a natural language engine so that students can just jot down a note, like they already prefer to do now, and we'll organize for them. Or making it automatically collaborative so that even if their phone's battery dies, as long as another classmate also uses Tabule, they're covered. We were able to do this by paying attention to students' behaviors and taking advantage of current trends to solve a problem in a way that was not possible before.

Similarly, schools need to adopt technologies that actually cater to student behaviors to influence little changes that add up. That's the only way we will bring education into the 21st century. Unfortunately, while schools decide whether to purchase the latest smart boards that nobody uses, students are suffering. We need to start thinking about how technology can solve real problems, not just how we can put it in the classroom.
