Your academic life revolves around homework assignments and exams, because those two things determine your grades. However, despite their importance, there's no easy way to manage your due dates. That's why students still write reminders on their hands or awkwardly text their classmates asking "hey, is there something due tomorrow?" It's even more frustrating when you consider that everybody in a class has the same due dates, yet everybody has to figure out their own solution to organizing them.

Tabule makes organizing due dates collaborative so you can focus on your actual work. When a classmate adds a due date, everybody gets notified, so you never miss an assignment, even if you miss a class. The best part is that it's really easy. There's no setup process or invite links. Just sign up with your .edu email, search for your classes, and add your due dates.

Version 1.2 of Tabule has significant design and usability improvements, and it also adds a few new features. Our goal with this update was to make the best standalone todo list for students, even without Tabule's collaborative features. Here are the three biggest changes:

**Adding Due Dates**

Adding due dates has always been easy, thanks to our intelligent natural language engine, but 1.2 makes it even easier! The first thing you'll notice is the beautiful sticky note design, instead of the old boring textbox. Our language engine has also received several under-the-hood improvements to make it even smarter, so you can add those due dates quickly and move on.

**Swipe to Complete**

You can't have a todo list without being able to mark tasks as completed. That's why 1.2 adds swipe to complete gestures! Just mark assignments off as you finish them for a satisfying ding. Also, any assignments that you forget to complete will now be visible in the Overdue section, so you don't need to worry about a task disappearing once its due date passes.

**Dot Charts**

Need to know if you have time to go out this weekend? How about if you any exams coming up this month? Now you can see how busy you are at a glance! Our unique dot chart view shows you which days have the most due dates, what percentage of those tasks you've already completed, and which days have exams. A bigger, darker blue circle means more things due. A red circle means there is an exam on that day. As an added bonus, the circles even turn grey as you complete tasks.

These are just a few of the many changes in the latest update to the best student planner. So what are you waiting for? Feed the koala!
