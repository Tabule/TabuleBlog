Organizing your student planner is no fun. Tabule makes it suck less by helping you team up with your classmates to track and discuss due dates, so you can focus on your actual work.

Version 1.2 of Tabule has a lot of shiny new features. Our goal with this update was to make the best standalone todo list for students, even without Tabule's collaborative features. Here are the three biggest changes:

**Adding Due Dates**

Adding due dates has always been easy, thanks to our intelligent natural language engine, but 1.2 makes it even easier! The first thing you'll notice is the beautiful sticky note design, instead of the old boring textbox. Our language engine has also received several under-the-hood improvements to make it even smarter, so you can add those due dates quickly and move on.

**Swipe to Complete**

You can't have a todo list without being able to mark tasks as completed. That's why 1.2 adds swipe to complete gestures! Just mark assignments off as you finish them. Also, any assignments that you forget to complete will now be visible in the Overdue section, so you don't need to worry about a task disappearing once its due date passes.

**Dot Charts**

Need to know if you have time to go out this weekend? How about if you have any exams coming up this month? Now you can see how busy you are at a glance! Our unique dot chart shows you which days have the most due dates, what percentage of those tasks you've already completed, and which days have exams. A bigger blue circle means more things due. A red circle means there is an exam on that day. Mark tasks as completed to watch the circles turn grey.

These are just a few of the many changes in the latest update to the best student planner. So what are you waiting for? Feed the koala!
