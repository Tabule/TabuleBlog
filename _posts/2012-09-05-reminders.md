We just added a couple features to Tabule that I wanted to take a moment to highlight. First, due to popular request, we've added reminder emails for events. You can choose to get a reminder one hour and/or one day before an event occurs. Just go to your course or group's settings page and enable it.

Second, we've added an option to receive a daily summary of what you've got planned for the day, so that you can wake up to a neat little schedule waiting for you in your inbox each morning. You can enable this from your [personal settings](https://tabuleapp.com/settings/). With this daily summary, you'll always know what you need to get done and never miss something important again.

We hope these new features help you out, and look forward to showing you what else we're working on for you!
