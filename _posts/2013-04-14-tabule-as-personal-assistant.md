Tabule is your smart student planner that makes adding homework as easy as writing a sticky note. But why settle for a student planner when you could have your own personal assistant? Here are 4 features that make Tabule work like your assistant.

# 1. Never forget an assignment

The perfect assistant would find out and remind you of homework that you didn't even know about. With Tabule, when a classmate adds an assignment, you see it on your todo list too. This means no more missed homework, even if you missed class. Just tell your classmates about Tabule to improve your planner.

# 2. Reminders

Tabule emails you a summary of everything you need to do today every morning, so your agenda for the day is waiting in your inbox when you wake up, without having to ask.

# 3. Forward your emails

Forward your emails to Tabule to quickly add them to your schedule. When your professor emails you to announce the bio lab that's due next Friday, just click forward and Tabule will take care of the rest. To find your personal Tabule email address, just look in your profile.

# 4. Text your homework

Wish you could just text your homework to an assistant to remind you later? Now you can! Text Tabule what's due, and it'll take care of organizing and remembering it for you. [Learn more](http://blog.tabuleapp.com/2013/01/25/tabule-for-sms/).
